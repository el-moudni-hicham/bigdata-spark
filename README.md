# Big Data Spark RDDs Projects 

```
This repository contains a collection of Big Data projects implemented using Apache Spark and Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).
Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides fast and general-purpose cluster-computing frameworks
for big data processing. RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) are a fundamental data structure of Spark, providing fault-tolerant
parallel processing of data.

## Overview
### Apache Spark
Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system for big data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. Spark also supports a rich set of higher-level tools, including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

### Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)
RDDs are a fundamental data structure of Apache Spark. They are fault-tolerant collections of objects partitioned across a cluster of machines. RDDs can be created from external data or by transforming other RDDs. They support two types of operations: transformations, which create a new RDD from an existing one, and actions, which return a value to the driver program or write data to external storage.
